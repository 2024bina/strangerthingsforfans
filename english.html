             process of creating the series
             <br>
          <p class="texto">
            The American streaming television series Stranger things of the genres science fiction, horror, suspense and teen drama, created, written and directed by brothers Matt and Ross Duffer for the Netflix platform. The Duffer brothers, Shawn Levy and Dan Cohen are also the executive producers.
              <br>
              <br>
              The Duffer brothers developed the premise of the series in mid-2015, and in the original script, the project would be called Montauk, and would be set in the city of the same name located in New York, addressing conspiracy theories involving the u.S. government's secret experiments at a military base in the city in the early 1980s. After defining the script, the Duffer brothers included several references to the cultural elements of that decade, such as science fiction films, supernatural horror and action and adventure, as well as video games, anime and music, as well as numerous references to works by Steven Spielberg, John Carpenter and Stephen King, considered the duffer brothers' great inspirations for the project. They were also inspired by strange experiments that took place during the Cold War and real-world conspiracy theories involving secret government experiments.
